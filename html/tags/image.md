## How to add image into HTML

```

#### You can make it smaller and bigger

```html 
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="My cat" width="10px" height="20px">
```



### Definition and Usage
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed
Note: Also, always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image load
